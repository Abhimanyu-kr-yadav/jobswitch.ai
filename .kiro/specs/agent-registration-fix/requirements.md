# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The JobSwitch.ai application is experiencing an issue where the job discovery agent is not being found by the orchestrator, resulting in "Agent job_discovery_agent not registered" errors when users try to discover jobs. This prevents the core job discovery functionality from working properly.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to be able to discover jobs without encountering "agent not registered" errors, so that I can find relevant job opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a job discovery request THEN the system SHALL successfully route the request to the job_discovery_agent
2. WHEN the orchestrator receives a task for job_discovery_agent THEN it SHALL find the agent in its registry
3. WHEN the application starts up THEN all agents SHALL be properly registered with the orchestrator before accepting user requests
4. WHEN an agent registration fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and provide fallback behavior

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to have visibility into agent registration status, so that I can troubleshoot issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL log successful agent registrations
2. WHEN an agent fails to register THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN checking system health THEN the health endpoint SHALL include agent registration status
4. WHEN agents are registered THEN the orchestrator SHALL maintain an accurate registry of available agents

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent registration process to be robust and handle initialization timing issues, so that the system is reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the orchestrator is initialized THEN it SHALL be ready to accept agent registrations
2. WHEN agents are being registered THEN the process SHALL wait for orchestrator readiness
3. WHEN there are initialization dependencies THEN they SHALL be resolved in the correct order
4. WHEN the system encounters registration errors THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages and recovery options
