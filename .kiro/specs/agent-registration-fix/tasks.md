# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Fix orchestrator initialization and readiness tracking





  - Add `is_ready` property and `wait_for_ready()` method to AgentOrchestrator
  - Ensure orchestrator is fully started before accepting registrations
  - Add proper state management for initialization phases
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 3.1, 3.2_

- [x] 2. Enhance agent registration with validation and retry logic











  - Add validation to `register_agent()` method to confirm successful registration
  - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for failed registrations
  - Add detailed logging for registration attempts and failures
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 2.2, 3.4_

- [x] 3. Fix application startup sequence and dependency management










  - Modify main.py to ensure proper initialization order
  - Add wait conditions between dependent initialization steps
  - Implement graceful error handling for initialization failures
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 2.1, 3.2, 3.3_

- [x] 4. Add agent registration status tracking and reporting





  - Create AgentRegistrationStatus data model
  - Implement registration status storage in orchestrator
  - Add methods to query agent registration status
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Enhance health check endpoint with agent status





  - Update health check to include orchestrator readiness status
  - Add registered agents list to health check response
  - Include agent registration timing and error information
  - _Requirements: 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 6. Implement fallback behavior for missing agents





  - Add error handling in jobs API when agents are not available
  - Provide meaningful error messages to users
  - Implement graceful degradation for unavailable agents
  - _Requirements: 1.4, 3.4_

- [x] 7. Add comprehensive logging and error reporting





  - Enhance logging throughout the registration process
  - Add structured error messages for troubleshooting
  - Implement startup timing and performance logging
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 3.4_

- [ ] 8. Create integration tests for agent registration flow
















  - Write tests for successful agent registration scenarios
  - Test error handling and retry logic
  - Test orchestrator initialization and readiness
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_
