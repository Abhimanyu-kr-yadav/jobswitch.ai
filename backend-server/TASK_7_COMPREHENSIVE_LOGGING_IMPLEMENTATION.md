✓ Step 3: Handling existing registration
✓ Step 4: Performing agent registration
✓ Step 5: Validating successful registration
✓ Agent test_good_agent registered successfully
```

### 2. Error Reporting with Context
```
✗ Agent registration failed for test_bad_agent
  - Error: Status check failed for test_bad_agent
  - Retry attempt: 1/3
  - Duration: 0.039s
  - Context: orchestrator_ready=True, phase=agent_registration
```

### 3. Performance Metrics
```
Performance: agent_registration_test_good_agent took 0.010s
