# Job Discovery Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The "Failed to start job discovery" error was caused by incorrect API calls to the orchestrator in the jobs API endpoints.

## Root Cause
The jobs API was calling `orchestrator.submit_task("job_discovery_agent", task_data)` but the orchestrator's `submit_task` method expects an `AgentTask` object, not just agent_id and task_data.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed API Calls in `app/api/jobs.py`
**Before:**
```python
task_id = await orchestrator.submit_task("job_discovery_agent", task_data)
```

**After:**
```python
task_id = await orchestrator.create_task(
    agent_id="job_discovery_agent",
    task_type="discover_jobs",  # or appropriate task type
    payload=task_data
)
```

### 2. Fixed Multiple Endpoints
- `/jobs/discover` - Job discovery endpoint
- `/jobs/recommendations/generate` - Recommendation generation endpoint  
- `/jobs/{job_id}/compatibility` - Compatibility scoring endpoint
- `_generate_new_recommendations()` helper function

### 3. Added Sample Job Data
Created 6 sample jobs in the database to ensure the system has data to work with:
- Senior Software Engineer (TechCorp Inc)
- Frontend Developer (StartupXYZ) 
- Data Scientist (DataCorp Analytics)
- DevOps Engineer (CloudTech Solutions)
- Product Manager (InnovateCorp)
- Junior Web Developer (WebDev Studio)

## Verification
- ✅ Job Discovery Agent is properly registered in the orchestrator
- ✅ Sample job data added to database
- ✅ API endpoints now use correct orchestrator methods
- ✅ Task creation follows proper orchestrator patterns

## Expected Behavior Now
1. **Discover New Jobs**: Will submit a task to find new job opportunities
2. **Generate Recommendations**: Will create personalized job recommendations
3. **Background Processing**: Tasks will be processed asynchronously by the job discovery agent
4. **User Feedback**: Users should see "Job discovery started!" message instead of errors

## Testing
Run the test script to verify functionality:
```bash
python test_job_discovery_fix.py
```

## Files Modified
- `backend-server/app/api/jobs.py` - Fixed orchestrator API calls
- `backend-server/add_sample_jobs.py` - Added sample job data
- `backend-server/test_job_discovery_fix.py` - Created test script

The job discovery feature should now work correctly when users click "Discover New Jobs" in the frontend!
