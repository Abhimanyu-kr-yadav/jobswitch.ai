The situation required immediate attention as it was affecting 15% of our user base. I took ownership of the problem and conducted a thorough analysis using Instruments and crash logs. I identified that the issue was caused by excessive memory usage in our image caching system. I implemented a more efficient caching strategy using NSCache with proper memory pressure handling and background queue processing. As a result, we reduced memory usage by 40% and eliminated the crashes, leading to a 25% improvement in our app store rating.",
