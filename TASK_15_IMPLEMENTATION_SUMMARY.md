- Integration with all existing agent components

**Features:**
- **Tabbed Navigation**: Clean tab-based interface for switching between different agents
- **Agent Integration**: Seamless integration with:
  - Job Discovery (`JobDiscovery`)
  - Skills Analysis (`SkillsAnalysisDashboard`)
  - Resume Builder (`ResumeBuilder`)
  - Interview Preparation (`InterviewPreparationHub`)
  - Networking (`NetworkingHub`)
  - Career Strategy (`CareerStrategyHub`)
- **State Management**: Persistent navigation state across user sessions
- **Quick Access**: Direct navigation from dashboard quick actions

### 4. Notification System for Agent Updates
**Files Implemented:**
- `jobswitch-ui/jobswitch-ui/src/components/dashboard/NotificationCenter.js`
- `jobswitch-ui/jobswitch-ui/src/components/dashboard/AgentActivityMonitor.js`
- Backend notification APIs in `dashboard.py`

**Features:**
- **Notification Center**: Dropdown panel showing all notifications with categorization
- **Agent Activity Monitor**: Header component showing real-time agent status
- **Notification Types**: Support for different notification types (job recommendations, skill gaps, resume optimizations, etc.)
- **Priority System**: High, medium, low priority notifications with visual indicators
- **Read/Unread Management**: Mark individual or all notifications as read
- **Real-time Updates**: Instant notification delivery via WebSocket
- **Notification Bell**: Visual indicator with unread count badge
